# Given three integers (, , and ) representing the three sides of a triangle, identify whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral.
# If all three sides are equal, output EQUILATERAL.
# Otherwise, if any two sides are equal, output ISOSCELES.
# Otherwise, output SCALENE.
# Input Format
# Three integers, each on a new line.
# Constraints
# The sum of any two sides will be greater than the third.
# Output Format
# One word: either "SCALENE" or "EQUILATERAL" or "ISOSCELES" (quotation marks excluded).

#This script prompts the user to input three integers representing the sides of a triangle,
# checks whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene according to the given conditions,
# and outputs the result accordingly.
# In Bash scripting, the -eq is a comparison operator used in conditional statements. Specifically,
# it checks if two numbers are equal. Here's a breakdown of what it does:
# -eq is used to compare if two values are equal.
# It is primarily used for numeric comparison within Bash scripting.
# For example, in the context of your previous script, [ $side1 -eq $side2 ] is checking if the value stored in the variable $side1
# is equal to the value stored in the variable $side2.
# If the values are indeed equal, the condition evaluates to true, and the corresponding code block associated with that condition is executed.
# It's essential to note that -eq is specifically for numeric comparison. For string or textual comparison, you'd typically use = or ==.
# Here's a list of some comparison operators used in Bash scripting:
# -eq: Equal to
# -ne: Not equal to
# -lt: Less than
# -le: Less than or equal to
# -gt: Greater than
# -ge: Greater than or equal to
# These operators are used within conditional constructs like if statements to compare values and make decisions based on those comparisons.
# In Bash scripting, && is a logical operator used for conditional execution in command lines or scripts. Specifically, && represents the logical AND operator.
# Here's how it works:
# When you use && between two commands or conditions, it means "execute the second command only if the first one succeeds (i.e., returns a zero exit status)."
# In conditional statements like if or in command sequences, && is used to connect multiple commands or conditions in a way that the subsequent command will execute only if the preceding one succeeds.
# For example:
# command1 && command2
#
# Here, command1 will be executed first, and if it returns a successful exit status (zero), command2 will be executed.
# If command1 fails (returns a non-zero exit status), # command2 won't be executed.
# In if statements, it can be used to combine multiple conditions. For instance:
# bash
# Copy Example:
# if [ condition1 ] && [ condition2 ]; then
#   Code to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are true
# fi
#
# This if statement will execute the code block if both condition1 and condition2 are true.
# && helps streamline the execution flow by allowing the script or command line to proceed only when the previous command or condition executes successfully.
